# Prescription-Storage-System
We came up with a project which recognises the text in the prescription of a doctor and stores in a database which is useful in the nearby future when we come up with the same kind of symptoms.
This document contains the organisation, the specifications, the conception, and verification tests of Text Recognition software development project.
It covers the following goals:
To create a database which stores the information of the prescription 
To read the text from the prescription
We used Tesseract and mysql database to build this project
